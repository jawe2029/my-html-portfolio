<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a life long passion in technology and computers but the opputunuties to learn coding were severely limited 
  when I was growing. With today's accessibility to a wealth of information, I can finally put into practice what I
  always wanted to do. 
</p>

<p>A hands-on father to my two sons, a husband, a brother and a friend. I always make time to balance the limited I have 
  into bonding with the people that matters and into learning coding to create more opputunuties for me.
